  abstract     = {A large number of clustering approaches have been proposed for the analysis of gene expression data obtained from microarray experiments. However, the results from the application of standard clustering methods to genes are limited. This limitation is imposed by the existence of a number of experimental conditions where the activity of genes is uncorrelated. A similar limitation exists when clustering of conditions is performed. For this reason, a number of algorithms that perform simultaneous clustering on the row and column dimensions of the data matrix has been proposed. The goal is to find submatrices, that is, subgroups of genes and subgroups of conditions, where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities for every condition. In this paper, we refer to this class of algorithms as biclustering. Biclustering is also referred in the literature as coclustering and direct clustering, among others names, and has also been used in fields such as information retrieval and data mining. In this comprehensive survey, we analyze a large number of existing approaches to biclustering, and classify them in accordance with the type of biclusters they can find, the patterns of biclusters that are discovered, the methods used to perform the search, the approaches used to evaluate the solution, and the target applications.},

In recent years, diverse co-clustering algorithms which group data points and features synchronously have shown their advantages over traditional one-side clustering.

In this paper, we provide a detailed understanding of six co-clustering algorithms with different performance and robustness. We conduct comprehensive experiments in eight real-world datasets to compare and evaluate these co-clustering methods based on four evaluation metrics including clustering accuracy, normalized mutual information, adjusted rand index, and purity. Our findings demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of these methods and provide insights to motivate further exploration of co-clustering methods and matrix factorization.},

Second, we adopt both supervised and unsupervised constraints to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. The unsupervised constraints are automatically derived from existing knowledge sources, thus saving the effort and cost of using manually labeled constraints. To achieve our first goal, we develop a two-sided hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model to represent both document and word constraints. We then use an alternating expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to optimize the model. We also propose two novel methods to automatically construct and incorporate document and word constraints to support unsupervised constrained clustering: 1) automatically construct document constraints based on overlapping named entities (NE) extracted by an NE extractor; 2) automatically construct word constraints based on their semantic distance inferred from WordNet. The results of our evaluation over two benchmark data sets demonstrate the superiority of our approaches against a number of existing approaches.},

The intelligent ability to learn these non-verbal cues of the humans is the key characteristic to develop efficient human computer interaction systems. Extracting an effective representation from facial expression images is a crucial step that impacts the recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel feature selection strategy using singular value decomposition (SVD) based co-clustering to search for the most salient regions in terms of facial features that possess a high discriminating ability among all expressions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known attempt to explicitly perform co-clustering in the facial expression recognition domain. In our method, Gabor filters are used to extract local features from an image and then discriminant features are selected based on the class membership in co-clusters. Experiments demonstrate that co-clustering localizes the salient regions of the face image. Not only does the procedure reduce the dimensionality but also improves the recognition accuracy. Experiments on CK plus, JAFFE and MMI databases validate the existence and effectiveness of these learned facial features.},

  abstract   = {All Netflix Prize algorithms proposed so far are prohibitively costly for large-scale production systems. In this paper, we describe an efficient dataflow implementation of a collaborative filtering (CF) solution to the Netflix Prize problem [1] based on weighted coclustering [5]. The dataflow library we use facilitates the development of sophisticated parallel programs designed to fully utilize commodity multicore hardware, while hiding traditional difficulties such as queuing, threading, memory management, and deadlocks.迄今为止提出的所有 Netflix Prize 算法对于大规模生产系统来说成本都高得令人望而却步。在本文中，我们描述了基于加权共聚 [5] 的 Netflix Prize 问题 [1] 协同过滤 (CF) 解决方案的高效数据流实现。我们使用的数据流库有助于开发旨在充分利用商用多核硬件的复杂并行程序，同时隐藏排队、线程、内存管理和死锁等传统困难。 The dataflow CF implementation first compresses the large, sparse training dataset into co-clusters. Then it generates recommendations by combining the average ratings of the co-clusters with the biases of the users and movies. When configured to identify 20x20 co-clusters in the Netflix training dataset, the implementation predicted over 100 million ratings in 16.31 minutes and achieved an RMSE of 0.88846 without any fine-tuning or domain knowledge. This is an effective real-time prediction runtime of 9.7 us per rating which is far superior to previously reported results. Moreover, the implemented co-clustering framework supports a wide variety of other large-scale data mining applications and forms the basis for predictive modeling on large, dyadic datasets [4, 7].数据流 CF 实现首先将大型稀疏训练数据集压缩为联合集群。然后，它通过将共同集群的平均评分与用户和电影的偏见相结合来生成推荐。当配置为识别 Netflix 训练数据集中的 20x20 联合集群时，该实施在 16.31 分钟内预测了超过 1 亿个评级，并且在没有任何微调或领域知识的情况下实现了 0.88846 的 RMSE。这是每次评级 9.7 us 的有效实时预测运行时间，远优于之前报告的结果。此外，已实施的联合聚类框架支持各种其他大规模数据挖掘应用程序，并构成了对大型二元数据集进行预测建模的基础 [4、7]。},

  abstract = {Global analyses of RNA expression levels are useful for classifying genes and overall phenotypes. Often these classification problems are linked, and one wants to find ``marker genes'' that are differentially expressed in particular sets of ``conditions.'' We have developed a method that simultaneously clusters genes and conditions, finding distinctive ``checkerboard'' patterns in matrices of gene expression data, if they exist. In a cancer context, these checkerboards correspond to genes that are markedly up- or downregulated in patients with particular types of tumors. Our method, spectral biclustering, is based on the observation that checkerboard structures in matrices of expression data can be found in eigenvectors corresponding to characteristic expression patterns across genes or conditions. In addition, these eigenvectors can be readily identified by commonly used linear algebra approaches, in particular the singular value decomposition (SVD), coupled with closely integrated normalization steps. We present a number of variants of the approach, depending on whether the normalization over genes and conditions is done independently or in a coupled fashion. We then apply spectral biclustering to a selection of publicly available cancer expression data sets, and examine the degree to which the approach is able to identify checkerboard structures. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our biclustering methods against a number of reasonable benchmarks (e.g., direct application of SVD or normalized cuts to raw data).},

  abstract = {Clustering is a powerful approach to analyze gene expression data which is crucial to the investigation of effective treatment of cancer. Many graph regularize-based clustering methods have been proposed and shown to be superior to the traditional clustering methods. However, they only focus on the inner structure in samples and fail to take the feature manifold into account. In gene expression data, it's practical to hypothesize that both the samples and the genes lie on nonlinear low dimensional manifolds, namely sample manifold and gene manifold, respectively. Therefore in this paper, incorporating the geometric structures in both samples and features, we propose a Dual Hypergraph Regularized PCA (DHPCA) method for biclustering of tumor data. First, for gene expression data, we construct two hypergraphs, i.e., sample hypergraph and gene hypergraph, to estimate the intrinsic geometric structures of samples and genes. Then, we introduce the hypergraph regularization on both gene side and sample side. Finally, our biclustering method is formulated as two hypergraph regularized PCA with closed-form solution. We experimentally validate our proposed DHPCA algorithm on real applications and the promising results indicate its potential in high dimension data analysis.},

Efficiently clustering those large scale data sets is a challenge.

Different from traditional k-means algorithms, the proposed method has two indicator matrices P and Q and a diagonal matrix S to be solved, which represent the cluster memberships of samples and features, and the co-cluster centres, respectively. Therefore, it could implement different clustering tasks on the samples and features simultaneously. We also introduce an effective approach to solve the proposed method, which involves less multiplication. The computational complexity is analyzed. Extensive experiments on various types of data sets are conducted. Compared with the state-of-the-art clustering methods, the proposed BKM not only has faster computational speed, but also achieves promising clustering results.}

However, the existing NMTF-based methods usually involve intensive matrix multiplications, which exhibits a major limitation of high computational complexity. With the explosion at both the size and the feature dimension of texts, there is a growing need to develop a parallel and scalable NMTF-based algorithm for text data co-clustering. To this end, we first show in this paper how to theoretically derive the original optimization problem of NMTF by introducing the Lagrangian multipliers.
